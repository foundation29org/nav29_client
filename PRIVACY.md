# Nav29 Privacy Policy

At Nav29, protecting your personal data is our priority. This privacy policy explains in simple terms how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Your data is important to us. We use it to evaluate how our artificial intelligence (AI) models perform, but never to train them.
